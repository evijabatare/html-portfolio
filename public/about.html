<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Evija Batare and this is my 1st week learning web development</p>

<p>Previously I have studied entrepreneurship and economy where I got bachelor's and master's degree</p>

<p>I have an orange cat and his name is Raichu. Yeah, like a pokemon! Most of his day he's sleeping, but he also loves to sit on a balcony. Every evening he's sitting on nightstand and waiting for treats.</p>
